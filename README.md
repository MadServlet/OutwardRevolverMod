# Outward Revolvers Plus Fix!
Just a simple Revolver Mod from Eiggy and JackJack86's work. Outward Revolvers Plus was nice but there was alot of recipes that were broken so I just took the idea and remade a simple version of it using SideLoader.

**Outward Revolvers Plus Fix!** allows you to convert your simple Pistol/Flintlock to have 6 shots instead of the traditional single shot.

# Recipes
The mod's recipe is simple. 

If its a **base Pistol**, combine it with **Palladium Scrap** and you'll get the **Revolver** version.

If its a crafted pistol (Obsidian Pistol, Bone Pistol, etc..), just replace the base Pistol with the Revolver version.
